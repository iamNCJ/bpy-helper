# bpy-helper

A lightweight alternative to BlenderProc

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/bpy-helper.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bpy-helper/) [![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/iamNCJ/bpy-helper/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iamNCJ/bpy-helper/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

## Why bpy-helper instead of BlenderProc?

BlenderProc needs a separate blender installation, and a lot of restrictions when using with other pypi packages. Debugging a BlenderProc script is also painful especially when you are using a headless environment. Hence I decide to build my own blender wrapper using `bpy`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install bpy-helper
```
